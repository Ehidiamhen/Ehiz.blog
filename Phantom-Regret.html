<p>You're tuned to Dawn FM,
   The middle of nowhere on your dial<br>
   So sit back and unpack,
   You may be here awhile</p>
<p>Now that all future plans have been postponed
   and it's time to look back on the things you thought you owned<br>
   Do you remember them well?
   Were you high or just stoned?
   And how many grudges did you take to your grave?<br>
   When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?
   Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
   Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?</p>
<p>If pain's living on when your body's long gone,
   and your phantom regret hasn't let it go yet<br>
   You may not have died in the way that you must<br>
   All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust;
   when you're all out of time, there's nothing but space<br>
   No hunting, no gathering;
   No nations, no race;
   And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face</p>
<p>When the purple rain falls,
   we're all bathed in its grace<br>
   Heaven's for those who let go of regret,
   and you have to wait here when you're not all there yet;
   But you could be there by the end of this song<br>
   Where The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week long,
   bang a gong, get it on<br>
   And if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scale..,
   You'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil</p>
<p>Consider the flowers, they don't try to look right;
   They just open their petals and turn to the light<br>
   Are you listening real close?
   Heaven's not that, it's this<br>
   It's the depth of this moment<br>
   You don't reach for bliss;
   God knows life is chaos,
   But He made one thing true;<br>
   You gotta unwind your mind,
   Train your soul to align,
   And dance 'til you find that divine...., boogaloo</p>
<p>In other words,<br>
   You gotta be Heaven.., to see Heaven<br>
   May peace be with you</p>
